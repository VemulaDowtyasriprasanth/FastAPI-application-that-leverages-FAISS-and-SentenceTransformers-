I've built a FastAPI application that leverages FAISS and SentenceTransformers to efficiently manage and search document embeddings. Hereâ€™s what it does:  Load and Embed Documents: Whether 


Load and Embed Documents: Whether it's text, PDFs, or URLs, our app can handle it. Documents are embedded using state-of-the-art models and stored in a FAISS vector index.
Retrieve Similar Documents: Quickly retrieve relevant documents based on a query, thanks to the power of FAISS and efficient embeddings.
Key Features
FastAPI for building robust and fast web APIs.
FAISS for efficient similarity search.
SentenceTransformers for generating high-quality embeddings.
Pydantic for data validation.
How It Works
Loading Documents: Simply post your document content, and it gets embedded and stored in our vector index.
Retrieving Documents: Submit a query, and our system fetches the most similar documents from the index.
